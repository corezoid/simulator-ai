# Simulator AI

Public MCP tools and portable skills for the new Simulator JSON-RPC API. This repository
is separate from [simulator-ai-plugin](https://github.com/corezoid/simulator-ai-plugin),
which continues to serve legacy. It does not change legacy configuration or routing.

**R1.1 + R1.2a development slices:** desktop stdio, API-user key, three metadata reads. It is not a
full legacy replacement or an accepted production release. Claude Code/Codex use their own
agent; this binary launches no Hermes, model, LiteLLM or server AI billing.

| MCP tool | Public RPC | Returned subset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `actor_get` | `actor/get` | id, title, description, formId, status, ref |
| `form_get` | `form/get` | id, title, description, type, parentId; no field schema/editor token |
| `layer_actors_list` | `graph/layer/actors/list` | One node-placement page, optional authorized actor metadata/position; no edges or total |

API scopes are `actors.readonly` / `forms.readonly`, plus existing workspace and object ACLs.
The server binds one explicit origin/workspace/key per process. Tools cannot supply another
workspace, arbitrary RPC, URL, credentials or `with` expansion. Read requests are never
coalesced with counts. No automatic retries, paid tests, writes or remote MCP in this slice.

## Local setup

Requires Go 1.27.2+ for source builds. From the checkout:

```sh
make test vet build
# Install the reviewed source's executable into your normal Go binary directory:
go install ./cmd/simulator-ai
```

Put that binary directory on the host client's PATH, or configure an absolute binary path.
Set these variables in the **client's process environment**, through its secret-management
mechanism. No default production endpoint or workspace is assumed:

- `SIMULATOR_AI_ORIGIN`: explicit `https://your-simulator-origin.example` (origin only).
- `SIMULATOR_AI_WORKSPACE`: workspace ID for the API user.
- `SIMULATOR_AI_API_KEY`: API-user key; never paste it into chat, a tool call or committed config.

Only literal loopback HTTP is accepted for local scripted development. HTTPS verifies TLS;
redirects are refused, including same-origin redirects, so credentials cannot be forwarded.
No login/OAuth is claimed. Normal human Bearer sessions are not accepted by this profile.

The `plugins/simulator-ai` directory includes Claude Code and Codex manifests, MCP config
and the portable `simulator-ai-read` skill. Its MCP command is the separately installed
`simulator-ai` binary. Install that plugin directory using your client's plugin mechanism,
or configure the MCP directly (the latter does not install the skill automatically):

```json
{"mcpServers":{"simulator-ai":{"command":"simulator-ai","args":[]}}}
```

Codex MCP configuration equivalent:

```toml
[mcp_servers.simulator-ai]
command = "simulator-ai"
args = []
env_vars = ["SIMULATOR_AI_ORIGIN", "SIMULATOR_AI_WORKSPACE", "SIMULATOR_AI_API_KEY"]
```

Do not store a key in either example. Use the client's environment injection to supply it.
Run `make client-smoke` to install into disposable Codex/Claude Code profiles and check real
client loading against a scripted loopback API, without a model turn. See
[client acceptance](docs/client-acceptance.md) for evidence and remaining live ACL/revoke gates.

## Development and contracts

[contracts/source.json](contracts/source.json) pins the source commit and complete public
OpenRPC digest. [public-openrpc.json](contracts/public-openrpc.json) is a projection containing
only the three public methods, copied from a locally generated public document. The Go
client's request types and returned metadata types are generated from that pinned source.
`make generate` updates code; `make gen-check` detects drift. Never import private/full RPC
snapshots or widen the catalog as a side effect of regeneration.

To refresh after a reviewed backend contract change, export `cmd/api-contract -public` from
the intended sim-api revision, select these same three methods, record its SHA/revision,
regenerate, inspect schemas and run tests. `make gen-check` verifies generated code locally;
hosted CI activation is pending (see [verification](docs/verification.md)). Local generation
checks cannot prove the deployed server matches the pinned source. [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
records transport/errors/limits and remaining gates.
